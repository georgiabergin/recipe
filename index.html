		<h1>Successful Meringue</h1>

		<p>Are your meringues flat? Do they lift off the pie when you try to cut them? Are they so tough they're difficult to chew? Try this vintage recipe, and maybe you'll end up with the perfect meringue.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
		<li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
		<li>3 egg whites</li>
		<li> 6 tablespoons sugar</li>
		<li> a few grains of salt</li>

	</ul>

		<p> Moisten the cornstarch with a small amount of water. Stir in the 1/2 cup of boiling water. Cook until thick and clear. Cool. Beat the three egg whites until stiff, add salt and then add sugar gradually. Beat in the cooked and cooled cornstarch and beat until it's the right consistency to stand in peaks. Brown as usual in a 375 degree F. oven.</p>

		<h3>There you have it, easy as pie!</h3>
